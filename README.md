# React + Vite
## Simple Todo List App

### Project Description
The Simple Todo List App is a minimalist task management application built using React.js. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks in a straightforward and intuitive interface.

### Key Features
- **Add New Tasks:** Users can easily add new tasks to their todo list by entering task descriptions in the provided input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Toggle Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking on a checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from their todo list by clicking on a "Delete" button next to each task.
- **Theme Toggle:** The app supports light and dark themes, allowing users to switch between different color schemes based on their preference or environmental conditions.
- **Local Storage Persistence:** Todos are stored locally using the browser's localStorage API, ensuring that users' todo lists persist across browser sessions.

### Technologies Used
- React.js: Used for building the user interface and managing component state.
- Bootstrap: Used for styling the user interface and creating responsive layouts.
- localStorage API: Used for persisting todo list data locally in the user's browser.

### Future Enhancements
- **Edit Tasks:** Allow users to edit task descriptions after they've been added to the todo list.
- **Sorting and Filtering:** Implement sorting and filtering options to help users organize and manage their tasks more effectively.
- **Multiple Lists:** Enable users to create and manage multiple todo lists for different purposes or categories.
